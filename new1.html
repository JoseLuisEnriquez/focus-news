            Eddie was first diagnosed with tongue cancer in 2000 and had to have a third of his tongue removed.
        </p>
        <p>
            He was declared cancer-free a couple of years later,
            but TMZ reported last year that his cancer had returned, only this time it was in his throat.
        </p>
        <p>
            The rocker had been reportedly flying back and forth between
            the United States and Germany for five years to get radiation treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sources told the outlet that the treatment seemed to be
            keeping the throat cancer in check and that Eddie was doing well,
            but that all took a turn after it spread to his brain and other organs.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the days leading up to Eddie’s death,
            doctors discovered his throat cancer had spread to his brain,
            as well as other parts of his body.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Netherlands-born, California-raised rock icon shared one child, son Wolfgang,
            with ex-wife Valerie Bertinelli.
        </p>

            <h2>Who are Eddie van Halen's wife and children?</h2>
            <p>
                LEGENDARY guitarist Eddie Van Halen was married to Janie Liszewski
                at the time of his death and had one son Wolfgang, with his ex-wife, Valerie Bertinelli.
            </p>
            <p>
                Eddie died on Tuesday at the age of 65 after a multi-year battle with throat cancer.
            </p>
            <p>
                He met his first wife, Valerie, at a Van Halen concert in Lousisiana in 1980, and the two hit it off.
            </p>
            <p>
                They got hitched the following year in California and welcomed their son,
                Wolfgang, a decade later, in 1991.
            </p>
            <p>
                Valerie filed for divorce in 2005, after a few years of separation, and it was finalized in December 2007.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Van Halen co-founder met proposed to his girlfriend
                Janie – an actress, stuntwoman and publicist – just the next year.
            </p>
            <p>
                Wolfgang, who is also a musician and the current bassist
                of his dad and uncle Alex’s Van Halen rock group, was the best man, while Alex was the officiant.

            Valerie and the guitarist were married from 1981 until
            the divorce was finalized in 2007, and he married Janie Liszewski a couple of years later.
        </p>
        <p>
            After forming Van Halen with his brother Alex in the early 1970s,
            the band went through lineup changes over the almost-40 years since.
        </p>
        <p>
            Wolfgang joined his dad and uncle’s band as the bassist in 2006,
            and he’s now one of the group’s three current members, which also includes lead vocalist David Lee Roth.
        </p>
        <p>
            Valerie reacted to her ex's passing by posting a row of
            broken heart emojis in response to their son's tribute before writing her own tribute.
